# DualBoxer
Dual-boxing addon for various versions of WoW.

## Features
1. DualBoxerXP is a small window on screen that shows you the current level and XP percentage of all party members using the addon.
2. AutoInvite allows people to whisper the party leader "inv" or "inv me" or "inv Velcrogloves" to have a character automatically invited to group.
3. AutoFollow allows you to whisper your alts or say in party chat who to follow and everyone using the addon will follow directions.  This also allows you to carry more than just your alts and lets the other person tell your alts to follow them and restart the auto-follow if your alts stop following for some reason.  You can whisper or say in group chat "follow", "follow me" or "follow Velcrogloves" and everyone will follow the person specified.
